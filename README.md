# android-core-architecture

## ðŸ’¡ About the Project

This is a complete code base that help to fast build a modern and high performance Android app.
The project provides core functions, guidelines demonstrate a modularized, scalable, maintainable, testable architecture, can be suitable for complicated and long lifecycle projects development.
The project contains a demo app to quickly highlights the usage of the defined core classes and functions.

## Built with ðŸ› 

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/): first class and official programming language for Android development.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html): for asynchronous and more.
- [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/): a cold asynchronous data stream that sequentially emits values and completes normally or with an exception.
- [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava): for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture): a collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
- [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel): stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
- [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding): generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module and allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
- [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room): SQLite object mapping library.
- [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager): an API that makes it easy to schedule deferrable, asynchronous tasks that are expected to run even if the app exits or the device restarts.
- [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started): refers to the interactions that allow users to navigate across, into, and back out from the different pieces of content within your app.
- [Encrypted SharedPreference](https://developer.android.com/topic/security/data): used to store key-value data using encryption.
- [Dependency Injection](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection): a technique widely used in programming provides the following advantages: reusability of code, ease of refactoring, ease of testing.
- [Hilt-ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-jetpack): DI for injecting `ViewModel`
- [Hilt-WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-jetpack): DI for injecting `WorkManager`.
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/): a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/): a library developed by Square for sending and receive HTTP-based network requests.
- [Material Components for Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android): modular and customizable Material Design UI components for Android.
- [Mockito](https://github.com/mockito/mockito): a mocking framework for unit test.
- [Mockk](https://mockk.io/): a mocking library specialized for Kotlin.
- [PowerMock](https://github.com/powermock/powermock): a framework that extends other mock libraries such as EasyMock with more powerful capabilities.
- [Firebase Analytics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics): an app measurement solution, available at no charge, that provides insight on app usage and user engagement.
- [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/products/crashlytics): Tracks, prioritizes & fixes stability issues that erode app quality.
- [LeakCanary](https://square.github.io/leakcanary/): memory leak detection library for Android.
